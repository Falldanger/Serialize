Object serialization

Make a shape with two fields: x and y. Also add buttons: “Save” and “Load”.
When entering x and y and pressing the “Save” button, an object of the Point class must be created, which must be serialized.
When clicking the “Load” button, the coordinates of the serialized object should be substituted into the x and y fields.
